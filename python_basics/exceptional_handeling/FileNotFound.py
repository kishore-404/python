# üß† Exception: FileNotFoundError

# ‚úÖ Definition:
# FileNotFoundError occurs when trying to open or access a file that does not exist at the specified path.

# ‚úÖ When it arises:
# - Using `open()` on a non-existent file in read mode
# - Trying to read from or write to a file path that is invalid or inaccessible
# - Incorrect file path or filename

# ‚úÖ Common causes:
# - Typos in file name or path
# - File deleted or moved
# - Relative vs absolute path mistakes
# - Permissions issues (less common for this error, usually permission denied)
